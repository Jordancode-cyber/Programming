Discussion
1.The six steps in software development process;
	.Specification-This helps us to specify what we want our software to do.
	.Design-We bascially create a blueprint of how we want our software to work and perform.
	.Implementation-We write the code we need to build the software.
	.Testing-We perform necesaary debugging and testing to ensure that our software is working the way we want it to be.
	.Documentation-We formulate neccessary procedures and instructions to guide users on how to use the software.
	.Maintenance-We continously update and maintain our software after deployment.
3. Relationships among loops;
	Definite loop-This runs a specified number of times.
	For loop-This is used to iterate over a sequence or range.
	Counted loop-This is often implemented with a for loop. It basically repeats itself a specific number of times.
5.Importance of writing an algorithm in pseudocode first;
	.Allows we users to plan easily and solve  problems without worrying on the syntax used.
	.It helps us to ensure clarity within our code.
	.Aloows us to effectively and easily debug especially when translating it to code.
